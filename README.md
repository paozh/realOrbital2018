# <BTO VIEWER!>

It has always been a hassle to search for relevant information online regarding Built-To-Order (BTO) flats. As the BTOs are released in batches, it can be difficult for users to obtain information on the historical prices of the different zones. There is also no current visualisation to help the user view the trend of BTOs over the past years. Moreover, as the BTO flats are yet to be built, it can be difficult for users to search for nearby ammenities as they would not know the exact location (e.g. postal code) of the BTO (They would only know the information on the zone). Hence, we decided to embark on a short journey to create a web app to help users by consolidating and visualising historical BTO prices and also, to show users on the exact location with the distance of nearby ammenities.
